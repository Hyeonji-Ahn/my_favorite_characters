<strong><a href="https://namu.wiki/w/토도로키%20쇼토" target="_blank" title="나무위키">Shoto Todoroki (轟とどろき焦しょう凍と Todoroki Shōto)</a></strong>
  is a student in Class 1-A at U.A.
 High School, where he got in through official recommendations and is training to become a Pro Hero.
 He is the youngest son of Endeavor, the No. 1 Hero, and one of the main protagonists of the series.

<h3>Appearance</h3><p>
Shoto is a reasonably tall, rather muscular young man who is well-built for his age.
 He has quite long hair, though it doesn’t pass his neck, and wears bangs, parted twice as to not obscure his vision.
  His hair is evenly split between two colors: white on his right-side and crimson red on his left, this unusual coloring being due to his Quirk.
As another result of this, he also possesses heterochromia iridium, which causes his left eye’s iris to appear turquoise,
while his right is a somewhat brownish dark gray. His eyes, in shape, are quite thin and reserved,
and he also has a large burn scar on the left side of his face, which reaches from his hairline to halfway down his cheek.
Despite this, however, several of the girls in his class have claimed that he is handsome,
 Mina Ashido even going as far as to say that he’s the best-looking guy in Class 1-A.
